# centered-cursor-mode.el
An emacs minor mode for smooth scrolling

Makes the cursor stay vertically in a defined position (usually centered) while scrolling. So instead of moving the cursor up and down it moves the page like a pager.

The vertical position can be customized. 

The code is still in development (see [todo list](TODO.md)).
