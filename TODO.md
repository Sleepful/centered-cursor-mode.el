- interactive first start isn't animated when calling `global-...` because it starts the modes for each buffer and `interactive-p` fails for that
- don't load keyboard shortcuts (like `C-M-+`) by default and provide function to load (like `(ffap-bindings)`)
- use `(while-no-input ...)`? see `post-command-hook` doc
- recalculate cursor position on some events like after `(default-text-scale)` if necessary
- acceleration on S-scroll like in `mwheel-scroll`
- consider `mouse-wheel-progressive-speed`
- consider `mouse-wheel-scroll-amount` for scroll wheel binding customization (allow also hyper etc)
- when executing `M-x command` that shows a suggestion "You can run the command ... with ..." only after the message recentering occurs (issue with `post-command-hook`?)
- with `ccm-vpos-up`/`ccm-vpos-down` set `vpos` is not remembered after buffer switch
- reconsider customization for cursor position:
  - no more `ccm-vpos-inverted` and more options: Center, Golden ratio, Golden ration from botton, Percentage, Lines from top or bottom
  - simple symbol or integer or float for saving (and more robust with wrong customizations)
- use `package-lint` on source file
- cursor position as window parameter instead of buffer local?

#### Combatibility with other packages
- package `default-text-scale`
- command `text-scale-increase` etc.
- package `undo-tree`
- `Info-scroll-down` doesn't scroll up to the top
- consider `recenter-top-bottom`?
