= centered-cursor-mode.el
An emacs minor mode for smooth scrolling

Makes the cursor stay vertically in a defined position (usually centered) while scrolling. So instead of moving the cursor up and down it moves the page like a pager.

The vertical position can be customized. 

The code is still in development (see link:TODO.adoc[todo list]).


== Technical

If recentering is triggered after some sort of mouse interaction and you don't
expect it to, this might indicate an incompatibility with some other mode you
are using. A quick way to figure out what commands are actually triggered when
you interact with the mouse is to use `command-log-mode` which will show you a
stream of the command history as the commands are being evaluated.

If any of the commands triggered on mouse interaction is not included in
`ccm-ignored-commands`, you have found the cause.
